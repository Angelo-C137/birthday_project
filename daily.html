        <p>Dear Haddassah,</p>
        <p>I was thinking about it and I think I'd actually want to go church with ou and the kids on Sundays you know. Thinking back, there were a lot of great wholesome moments
            that came from my whole family going to church as one. We'd sit in the living room, eat food as we ket the wind enter the house on a hot Sunday afternoon and talk about the sevice
            of the day. I want that baba. And I want that with you &#128106. (I hate that my eyes get teary every time I write about us and our future )</p>
        <p>Love always,</p>

        <p>Dear Haddassah,</p>
        <p>This is honestly my least favorite day of the week. Cuz it's not thursday which means Friday as still very far<br>
            Even on my least favorite day the thought of being your man is more than enough to make my day. Because that's what you do:
            you not only make my day but having makes the sunshine brighter, the smell of flowers better, even music sounds more better.
            <br>You light up everything you touch bae</p>
        <p>With all my love,</p>
        <p>Your Other Half<br>Angelo Goliath</p>

            <br> And I hope aren't thinking I'm saying this cuz I'm your boyfrined.

        <p>Dear Haddassah,</p>
        <p>Ahhh Saturdays.<br> Usually we'd groove on Fridays but every so now and then we'd go on Saturday as well. This is probably isn't a good think to admit but I loved how 
            people would be amazed by us on the dance floor and in public. It's like we're telling them "Yeah this type of love exist. Be patient for it, it will come"<br>
            To many more nights out my princess &#128526</p>
