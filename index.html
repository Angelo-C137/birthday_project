  <h1>Happy Birthday Haddassah George!</h1>
  <p>To my babygirl, with love</p>
  
  <div id="letter">
    <p>Dear Haddassah,</p>
    <p>
        As I'm writing this I'm listening to Can You Stand The Rain by New Edition<br>
        I sit with a big smile cuz every moment with you puts my heart in ignition<br>
        It's the day I told you I'm outside as usual<br>
        When I saw you I was struck by this woman that's nothing less than beautiful<br>
        I walked up the stairs, held your face and stared into your eyes<br>
        I was awestruck because I experinced how time files<br>
        I saw dates, I saw a wedding, I saw the mother of my kids, I saw forever<br>
        I knew then and there this is a bond I don't ever want to sever<br>
        The rain was pouring on us but I didn't care<br>
        I kissed you and for the fisrt time in a long while... I made a prayer<br>
        <br>
        This day is all about you bun bun<br>
        Because your birthday is in January your birthday always signifies a new start<br>
        And I know that can be daunting, especially if the previous year didn't go as planned  <br>
        I don't know what this year has in store for you princess<br>
        I only know that you'll face every challenge you need to face<br> 
        Because you're not just a pretty face<br>
        You're smart, you can adapt to inurmountable situations and your social skills are top notch<br>
        You're also one heck of a grilfriend<br>
        You're kindness, wisdom and patience has comforted in moments where I didn't want to confide in anynone, not even you<br>
        But you're stubborn. You'll never just let me be sad or angry. You'll be like "Fine if you want to be angry I'll be angry with you"<br>
        You won't ever force feelings out of me and you won't ever let me face a difficult time alone<br>
        That right there is why you're my princess, that's why you're the only woman I want to raise my kids with<br>
        You're awesome babe. Not just as a girlfriend, but as a friend as well<br>
        Don't ever change who you are at your core bun bun<br>
        Your flaws and imperfections are notthing to feel ashamed about, they're additions to your unique personality.<br>
        The unique personality I fell in love with<br>
        The unique personality so many people become friends with<br>
        The unique perosnality that will light up the world
    </p>
    <p>Love always,</p>
    <p>Your Stinka Bud<br>Angelo Goliath</p>
